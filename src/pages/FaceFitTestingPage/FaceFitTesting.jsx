            Ensuring that tight-fitting disposable and reusable respirators form an effective seal with the wearer‚Äôs face is a 
            legal requirement. Face Fit Testing verifies that respiratory protective equipment (RPE) provides adequate protection 
            against hazardous substances.

          {/* About Face Fit Testing */}
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            At SEI.TECH International, we offer **qualitative Face Fit Testing** conducted by trained assessors across the UK. 
            This testing ensures disposable and reusable half-mask respirators seal properly, preventing the inhalation of 
            harmful particulates.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Recognized by the **Health & Safety Executive (HSE)**, Face Fit Testing is essential for effective respiratory 
            protection, safeguarding employees against workplace hazards.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Fit testing ensures that a tight-fitting mask forms a secure and effective seal around the wearer‚Äôs face. If the 
            seal is compromised, harmful particles may bypass the mask and enter the respiratory system, causing serious 
            health risks.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The **Face Fit Test** includes a saccharin taste test where a **sweet or bitter solution** is introduced into a hood 
            worn over the individual‚Äôs head. The wearer performs **a series of exercises** to ensure the mask‚Äôs seal remains intact 
            during normal activities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            **Regular RPE inspections** are still necessary. Wearers should check for wear and tear before each use and replace or 
            repair affected components as needed.
